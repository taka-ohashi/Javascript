The src directory contains the source files for the counter-app.
To run this code, the user should have a npm create-react-app setup.
Simply drag/replace the src directory, then npm start to run the application.

This web-application gives users to dynamically interact with the UI.
The counter app allows users to click on "+" or "-" to change the value on the screen.
A practical application of this app would be a shopping cart, where a customer changes the number of repeated items he or she wants to purchase
The delete button will also dynamically delete rows of items and the navbar can be clicked to restore the web-page or simply be used to track how many counts exist.
