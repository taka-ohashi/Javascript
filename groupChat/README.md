## Simple Group chat
This group chat utilizes express.js, sockets.io, and node.js to allow up to two users to communicate with each other. Once, the third person comes in to join the chat, one will be booted off the server. 

index.js is the main file and will render a index.ejs file, which will be the client front-end file.
